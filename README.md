# Computer Vision
# Introduction:
Object detection for office security . In some offices the employees are required to leave their bags near security before entering into the office The purpose of this project is to create a program which detects bags and helps security where some one may enter into the office with bags.
## Image dataset used for training and the weights are in the drive link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ownKYLXUIceoStnBa62FkhiF9JL2z_ri?usp=sharing)

# Training:
I have trained it using google colab. I have uploaded the Train_YoloV3_.ipynb folder. For training you should link your google drive in colab. You should create a folder called yolov3 in google drive. You should upload your image dataset named images.zip inside the yolov3 folder.Then using colab just run the training file.

# Testing:
For testing you can run the python program uploaded. In the python program you should change the path of the weights and where images are located in your computer. Then you can run to get the result.
