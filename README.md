# Introduction
This repository contain all the work done while being an intern at UST Global during June-July 2020.

# Project
Object Detection frameworks - Understand available frameworks(YOLOv3) and build pipeline for customer object detection tasks.
In this project we needed to create a custom dataset(for this project only bags) and train it our yolov3 model on this dataset.

# How to create a custom dataset
There are many software available that can be used to create a custom dataset. But the one I have used in this project and found it very user frienly is labelImg.
A detailed tutorial on how to use labelImg can be found [here](https://www.arunponnusamy.com/preparing-custom-dataset-for-training-yolo-object-detector.html).
